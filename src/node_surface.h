// A port of wlroots' wlr_scene_surface, wlr_scene_subsurface_tree, wlr_scene_xdg_surface,
// and wlr_scene_drag_icon onto own nodes (MIT licensed, as
// wlroots; the logic follows types/scene/*.c of wlroots 0.20). A surface is an own buffer
// node whose content follows the wl_surface; a surface with subsurfaces is a tree of
// them, stacked as the protocol orders them. The binding listens to the buffer node's
// signals, which the projection and the output pass raise: outputs_update,
// output_sample and frame_done.
